how Retriever works in Gen AI:
Let’s say a user asks: “What’s the latest research on quantum computing?”

Query Embedding: The retriever will convert this question into an embedding that captures its meaning.
Search: The retriever searches a database or corpus of research papers, articles, or other documents for content related to “quantum computing research.”
Similarity: It finds the most relevant research papers or abstracts by measuring the semantic similarity to the query.
Response Generation: The generative model combines information from these documents to generate a concise, informative response.
